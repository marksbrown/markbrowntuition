    <p>Finding good resources for understanding good tutoring can be difficult.
It can be easy to fall into the trap of believing teaching resources are wholly suitable.
In my opinion, this is not the case.
Tutoring involves a much greater emphasis on the individual student's strengths and weaknesses.
This in contrast to teaching, where a teacher has to ensure a single cohort of students moves through material together.</p>
<p>A teacher is responsible for ensuring the modal demographic of a class is moving through the syllabus at the appropriate rate (no mean feat!).
This involves much more lesson planning and juggling to my mind that than in tutoring.
Tutoring on an individual level typically focuses on helping students catch up with previous material and perhaps more importantly understand why they fell behind the first place.
In this guide I will present my findings from reading and from my experience as a tutor.</p>
<div class="section" id="planning-ahead">
<h2>Planning ahead</h2>
<p>As mentioned planning a lesson is the domain of teaching not tutoring.
By comparison a tutor can make some level of plan, for example in this class we will cover simple harmonic motion, but this should not be a rigid guideline.
Often a student will cover a new topic and wish to cover this briefly.
Or a question from a test recently sat was particularly difficult.
A tutor should be able to jump from their original plan to covering this new material quickly.
This first quality, being able to adapt, is the first sign of a good tutor.
This not only requires a good grasp of the whole syllabus (and generally beyond), it also requires that the tutor be able to think of examples, analogies and references for various topics.
This does take time.
A good starting position can often be to familarise yourself with textbooks at the correct level.
For instance, my goto reference for all my A level physics students is 'A level physics' by Roger Muncaster.
Questions are especially important as students, especially when at first they may be uncomfortable, will not explicitly say they do not understand.
This can mean your lesson can disappear exceedingly quickly if you are not careful!
Try to be mindful of the lesson length and what needs to be covered but do not be afraid to shift the focus of the lesson.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-to-cover">
<h2>What to cover?</h2>
<p>An hour is not a long time.
During a single lesson time needs to be found to not only cover new material but also review previous lessons.
This challenge is compounded over time as content from not only weeks but months ago must be reviewed.
As a tutor you should endeavour to determine the 'information half-life' of your student.
Specifically - how long does stuff stick?
Very rarely do students recall material perfectly after one sitting.
Most will have an incomplete or imprecise understanding, generally falling back to what they may have previously memorised.
Some will forget content between weekly sessions.
In all three(!) cases it is essential homework assigned by the school or yourself is completed.
In the same vein - do not cover homework during tutorials.
For the student, this can seem like an effective use of time.
It is rather essential you steer away from this.
Helping with homework <em>after</em> it has been attempted by a student can be useful to determine areas to cover but this must not end up with you completing the students work!</p>
<p>For general lessons, the amount of content to actually cover will vary depending on subject and age group.
As a rule of thumb, the younger the student the less material you should attempt to cover.
I would also suggest that longer lessons whilst making financial sense, do not generally help.
Tutorials should be intensive one-to-one learning.
Both you and the student should be feel some exertion has taken place!
Longer sessions can be useful where questions given are longer and require more time to work through.
This can be especially true for A level mathematics students where a few minutes thinking about a diagram or derivation may be neccessary.</p>
<p>Attempting to cover too much material can be seen when you find yourself 'lecturing' the material rather than interacting.
In this case, the student will generally be mute or nodding and in all likelihood letting their mind wander.
Do not do this!
When presenting new material it is essential to introduce a new concept and test the student immediately.</p>
<p>How much time to assign to new and to review I would leave to the tutor.
In short, if you find that the review is a bigger struggle than you expected, do not feel compelled to continue with your original lesson.
Tutoring has the wonderful quality that a students understanding of the subject should supercede the immediate needs of the syllabus.
This is even more true if an exam is months away.
There is very little point covering new material if the old has not sunk in.</p>
<p>Understanding why a student does not grasp material is perhaps the most important job of the tutor.
This can be flagged in three ways.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>By questioning in person or exam.</li>
<li>By mistakes made in review of material</li>
<li>By the student directly</li>
</ol>
<p>The latter of these three is rare and unreliable!
Understanding the limits of our own knowledge is difficult to say the least.
For students, and in this we should often include ourselves, the limits of our knowledge can not be explcitly known in many cases.
In [3 - effortful learning] the idea of working in the grey area of the unknown-unknown is essential for pushing ourselves forwards.</p>

<h2>How much to help?</h2>
<div class="section" id="building-confidence">
<h3>Building Confidence</h3>
<p>The most important job a tutor can do in my mind is build a students confidence in a subject.
Especially in subjects like mathematics, where a mindset of &quot;I can't do it!&quot; is common, students must be in a relaxed environment.
This leads to perhaps the most important piece of advice - Do not ever be (or act) frustrated.
Obvious questions are not obvious if you do not know the answer.
Frustration on a tutors part is perhaps the worst thing you can do for the students education.
You are essentially saying the material is easy and they are stupid.
In my experience, there are no easy questions.
Patience of a saint is what we as tutors should aspire to!
This does not cover difficult students, whom I leave as an exercise for the reader.
But for the vast majority of students, it is difficult enough mastering</p>
