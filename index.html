<h2>What is your teaching philosophy?</h2>
<p>In nearly all cases my job as a tutor is to fix one of three issues.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>'domain knowledge' : These are cases where the student has forgotten or completely misunderstood the material.
Depending on the volume of material to cover, this is generally just a matter of time and is the easiest problem to fix.
For most cases material can be taught by example.
Following this questions can be attempted in class with further work on the content left as additional training.
Future classes will refer back to this content to determine how ingrained material has become with the student.
For some, this will mean a short 5 minute review per session, for others this can mean dedicating a third of each class towards building long-term memory.
Ideally I would test on new content on a one day, one week, one month and two month basis per topic area.
In this way topics are learnt properly, solidifying important concepts for further education.</li>
<li>'Slip ups' : These are the multitude of 'silly mistakes' we all make from time to time.
For some students this could be forgetting to write out full methodology or other cases consistently introducing errors into algebra.
These slip ups can seem much more frustrating than simply not knowing the material.
These issues are harder to identify, but over regular sessions getting to know a student, these slip ups become apparent.
Once identified, I can suggest heuristics to counter the issue before the mistake is made.
For instance converting all numbers in a physics exercise into SI standard form.
Another method might be having a rigid checklist to follow on specific questions.
Whilst inconvenient at first, this kind of technique works well.</li>
<li>'Exam Technique' : Broadly put this is to understand fully what a question is asking and how to go about answering it.
For some this can mean parsing a question in understandable English.
For others it can be identifying the intentional pitfalls that many examiners introduce.
In nearly all cases improving exam technique is a matter of attention to detail.
This is especially important in A level mathematics where a small misunderstanding can cost the student a whole grade boundary.
The first step therefore is to build familiarity with the style of questions a student may be asked to answer.
Initial efforts begin by seeing how students interpret intentionally vague questions on a subject.
Whilst most certainly unfair this is a necessary step in teaching the student to see themes and required topics to bring to bear in a given question.
The next (effective) method has a student sit a mock examination and mark the paper themselves according to the official mark scheme.
Contrasting this with the examiners report (a document typically describing the successes and failures of the cohort sitting the actual exam) can be very eye opening for the student.
This is especially helpful with students for whom the disparity between their knowledge and their exam grades is unclear.
Thirdly, exposure to harder questions than those that will be on the exam paper.
This has two effects.
This helps build mastery in a given topic.
Once a student finds that a topic is easy, questions on that material no longer seem as scary or stressful.
This is also means more of the exam time is spent on the harder material.</li>

<div class="section" id="randomly-asked-questions">
<h2>Randomly Asked Questions</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>When did you develop an interest in your chosen field and in private tutoring?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I've always been fascinated with teaching. Throughout my academic journey, I found that assisting fellow students with their programming or mathematics challenges was not only a way to help them but also a powerful means of deepening my own understanding of the subject matter. It was through these experiences that I truly comprehended the value of one-to-one teaching.</p>
<p>One particular aspect that drew me towards private tutoring is the unique opportunity it provides to engage with students on an individual level. Every student possesses their own distinct learning style, strengths, and areas for improvement. When faced with a challenging question from a student, it prompts me to approach the topic from a fresh perspective and explore different ways of presenting the necessary information.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Tell us more about the subject you teach, the topics you like to discuss with students (and possibly those you like a little less).</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I specialise in teaching physics, mathematics, and computer science. While these subjects may appear distinct, they share common threads in problem-solving and the application of learned principles to yield new results.</p>
<p>In my lessons, I particularly enjoy delving into topics such as functions in Python, trigonometry in mathematics, and waves in physics. These areas provide students with powerful tools that they can utilise to tackle a wide array of problems across different disciplines. I find great satisfaction in helping students grasp these fundamental concepts and witness how they can be applied in practical situations.</p>
<p>However, I must admit that there is one aspect of teaching that occasionally challenges me: an overemphasis on &quot;spoonfeeding&quot; style problems. I believe that true learning necessitates a balance between guidance and independent thinking. While it is important to provide support and guidance to students, I am not a proponent of merely giving students ready-made solutions without engaging their critical thinking skills. I firmly believe that genuine understanding comes from grappling with challenging problems. It is persistence through moments of frustration that leads to mastery of a topic.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>Did you have any role models; a teacher that inspired you?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been fortunate to have several role models in my teaching journey who have inspired and influenced my approach to education. These role models have predominantly been academics who have demonstrated key aspects related to the philosophy of teaching.</p>
<p>During my formative years, I was blessed to have teachers who believed in me and my potential. They provided unwavering support and guidance, encouraging me to push my boundaries and explore further. These teachers not only imparted knowledge but also suggested additional reading materials and resources that deepened my understanding and nurtured my love for learning. I am particularly grateful to a teacher I had in my final year of GCSEs, as their support and belief in me played a significant role in propelling me to university &amp; beyond.</p>
<p>As I grew older, I had the opportunity to observe and learn from academics and other teachers who showcased exceptional teaching practices. One crucial aspect I learned from them is the power of empathy in building strong relationships with students. These educators demonstrated genuine care and understanding for their students' needs and wellbeing. Their empathetic approach fostered a positive and supportive learning environment, enabling students to approach their studies with a better mindset and achieve greater success.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>What do you think are the qualities required to be a good tutor?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>To be a good tutor, several key qualities are essential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patience</strong>: Patience is crucial when working with students of varying learning paces and abilities. A good tutor understands that everyone learns at their own speed and is willing to provide additional explanations or examples when needed. Patience helps create a supportive and nurturing learning environment.</p>
<p><strong>Empathy</strong>: Empathy allows a tutor to understand and connect with their students on a deeper level. Each student has unique challenges and learning styles, and an empathetic tutor recognises and accommodates these individual differences. By being empathetic, a tutor can tailor their teaching approach to suit the specific needs and goals of each student, fostering a positive and personalised learning experience.</p>
<p><strong>Extensive Domain Knowledge</strong>: A good tutor possesses a strong command of the subject matter they teach. They have a deep understanding of the core concepts, methodologies, and applications within their field. This expertise enables them to provide accurate and comprehensive explanations, guide students through complex problems, and offer valuable insights beyond the textbook material.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Communication</strong>: Clear and concise communication is a vital quality for a tutor. The ability to explain complex concepts in a simple and understandable manner is key to facilitating effective learning. A good tutor can break down difficult topics into manageable parts, use appropriate examples and analogies, and actively listen to students' questions and concerns.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>Provide a valuable anecdote related to your subject or your days at school.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>A professor of mine once remarked</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;If someone asks you a difficult question in a field of study that you cannot answer, that's perfectly fine. Nobody expects us to be perfect or have all the answers. However, if someone asks you an easy question in that same field, and you cannot answer it, then that's when you should worry!&quot;</blockquote>
<p>This statement resonated deeply with me because it highlighted the critical role that foundational knowledge plays in our understanding and expertise. It reminded me that while tackling complex and challenging concepts is certainly important, it is equally essential to have a strong grasp of the basics. Without a solid foundation, it becomes increasingly difficult to comprehend and explain more advanced topics.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="6">
<li>What were the difficulties or challenges you faced or still facing in your subject?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of the content I teach can often be presented as disparate and disconnected. For instance, when a student asks about the behaviour of logarithms, providing a simple set of rules may not be sufficient. Understanding logarithmic behaviour requires context, examples and a good comprehension of exponentiation. When presented an isolated topic, the information can be difficult to grasp and hard to remember. However, presenting this information within the broader framework of the subject can not only improve a student's understanding of the material; they are more likely to remember it. The alternative is expecting students to memorise a seemingly unending barrage of information.</p>
<p>As a tutor, my role is to bridge this gap by tailoring the information to the student's level of comprehension. It is crucial to find ways to make complex concepts more accessible and relatable. I strive to provide meaningful context, real-world examples, and practical applications to help students grasp the subject matter more effectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="7">
<li>Do you have a particular passion? Is it teaching in general or an element of the subject or something completely different?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a multifaceted passion that encompasses both teaching and intellectual challenges. One of the primary draws to tutoring for me is the intellectual challenge of comprehending and catering to the unique understanding of each student. It is immensely fulfilling to witness the progress of motivated students and to be able to contribute to their accelerated learning journey.</p>
<p>Beyond the immediate gratification of assisting students, tutoring also allows me to continually evaluate my own understanding of the subject matter. It prompts me to reflect on which topics resonate more with students, the logical sequence of concepts to cover, and how different elements of the material relate to one another. This ongoing process enhances my own grasp of the subject and ensures that my teaching remains effective and comprehensive.</p>
<p>In addition to teaching, I have two other significant passions that currently occupy my interests. Firstly, I am deeply engaged in exploring syllabus design through an algorithmic approach. By designing curricula that intelligently connect and relate different material, I aim to create a more coherent and contextualised learning experience for students. This has given me an opportunity to not only improve my computer programming skills but also to analyse relationships between subject areas of different subjects and identify areas I feel are currently badly served by existing syllabi.</p>
<p>Secondly, I am currently refurbishing my home, which is a narrowboat located on the canals of the UK. Over the last few years I've learnt a great deal about diesel engines, DIY, logistics and nature. The hands-on approach whilst frustrating at times is immensely satisfying when you see the results. Amongst many projects, I've fitted a wet room, laid a parquet floor, rewired &amp; repaired a diesel engine. Each time I've learnt something; usually about the nature of the difference between a theoretical &amp; practical knowledge!</p>
